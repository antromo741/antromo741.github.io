Hi, my name is Anthony Romagnolo. I decided to get into coding to become a software devoloper. I hoped that with this skill i'd be one step closer to getting a good job. I currently have a bachelors in physics and cannot do anything that intrests my that much. Other than education, it seems there's only a few things I can do. I work as a tutor and can in no way see myself becoming a teacher. I am good with kids, but I want to do something more on the physics research side. I'm hoping that with this coding experience I can start getting in the direction of what I want to be doing years from now. 
SoI decided to code to try and get some freedom away from becoming "trapped" as I see it staying in education. I am hoping for the best, but whatever happens, happens. :-)
