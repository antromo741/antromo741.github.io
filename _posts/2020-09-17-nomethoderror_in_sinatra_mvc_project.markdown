Something that you will run into very often while doing your Sinatra project, is a really fun error called the NoMethodError. This will happen while running shotgun in your terminal. Now your server is up and running, you type in the url some thing like similar to this http://127.0.0.1:9393/ferret/something_wrong and wait for the view to render, only it never renders and you get redirected to a page like below:
