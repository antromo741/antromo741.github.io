Logic is really important in coding, like realy important. Not Logic the rapper, although he is cool. Almost all of coding requires conditionals to run properly. We wouldn't be able to sort, or run any loops. Something I think that would have been helpful for the conditinals and loops section in Flatiron would be a simple logic game to code. Something a little easier than  the tic-tac-toe lab haha. A game like 'Rock, Paper, Sciccors' maybe.  Even doing some more complicated loops with a tutorial I believe would be helpful.  However the material provided was fine and got the message across just fine. I am currently working on my project. I think I am going to incoporate some of my favorite things, probably either science or Nintendo.
