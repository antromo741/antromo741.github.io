As I am sitting here coding away at my final project, I am reflecting on myself this time last year. I had coding knowledge, but nothing that I could really use to do anything except math and physics calculations. Now I feel I truly understand what coding is about. It’s not just solving problems. It's about taking what's in your mind and adding it to the digital world. The computer contains its own universe with its own set of rules. Logic can be manipulated to do essentially anything, the computer is so powerful and I never fully understood until recently. It is clear that technology is advancing at an exponential rate. More and more we are seeing VR, AR, AI, Quantum computers and a serious increase in the digital world’s assets from crypto currencies to ntfs. The world is becoming more digital and I am happy to be a part of that world and finally be able to contribute to it. I truly get excited when learning new coding languages as well as all the little tricks and tips to do what looks like coding magic. Recently with react it feels like I just got a real power boost. 

With a minimal amount of code we can produce a fully functioning, responsive application that would have taken hours and hundreds of lines of code to get the same outcome without it. The best part of react is being able to import all these functions from another source to keep my code clean, while still doing a lot. My favorite recently has been tailwind.css. It has made all my design and styling really look really good without having to create a whole css file and code all the logic you would need. I sat on the website and went through basically every command and watched how it affected the visual. This was very fun for me and helped me memorize code to use on the fly. It made designing my final project really simple. I was able to use inline code to do so much, we can easily change the font, create rows, have small animation, with just a few pieces of code.

I have also started using a helpful program called tabnine which is truly amazing. It essentially learns the way you code and will give options of things you may want to finish with as you type. It makes coding even faster, and I feel it is a really intelligent way of coding. Intelligence here could also be argued as laziness, but that is for you to decide. [](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Every time we advance to the next module and start using a more convenient way of doing things it shows me that there is always a way to improve upon logic, I felt really discouraged for a while thinking that everything that could be done was probably done, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In my career I hope at some point I am working at a high coding level where we contribute positively to society. Whether it be through some type of amazing affordable software or perhaps a business that does good for the people supporting it.
