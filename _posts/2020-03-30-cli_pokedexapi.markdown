For my CLI project, I wanted to do something fun that I could customize and also show off to my nerd friends. I really like Nintendo so my project started off as a Smash Bros gem that would essentially kick back some basic info about the charachter chosen. I was able to meet the requirments of the project, but it felt pretty bland and there was only so much I could do with the charachter info. I decided to switch the direction of my project to feature pokemon. There was alot more data that I could access for making my CLI app in addition to it being alot more fun to customize all the small bits. It allowed me to get more creative and think of more ideas.  Right now the pokedex can access any pokemon by typing in an associated ID number. Then it will display some stats about the pokemon, we can also see a lists of moves and get stats on that as well. I have the displayed list limited to save some loading times, but it can easily be manipulated to show them all. I had alot of fun with this project, and believe I walked away with better coding logic. Hopefully professor Oak would be proud of my small endeavor.
